# Hadoop Architecture

Hadoop framework includes following four modules:

* **Hadoop Common**: These are Java libraries and utilities required by other Hadoop modules. These libraries provides filesystem and OS level abstractions and contains the necessary Java files and scripts required to start Hadoop.
* **Hadoop YARN**: This is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.
* **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFSâ„¢)**: A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
* **Hadoop MapReduce**: This is YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.
